# The Recommendation System<br/>

This segment of project focuses on developing a trend recommendation system using the Myntra dataset. Myntra, as a leading e-commerce platform in fashion and lifestyle, provides a vast repository of data encompassing customer preferences, product attributes, sales history, and more. The goal is to leverage this data to build a robust recommendation system that suggests trending fashion items to users based on their preferences and current market trends.<br/>


This recommendation system is built using various recommandation algorithms such as popularity based ,content based and collaborative filtering.

Popularity Based Recommender System works on the principle of popularity and or anything which is in trend. It recommends products based on Total Number of Ratings on products and average product rating given by users and fetch popular amongst them.

Content Based Recommender System works on the principle of similar content. It recommends products based on similar content of the product.The model recommands similar products to the user based on cosine similarity.


## Goals of the project<br/>

The main goal of this recommendation system is to provide a personalized fashion recommendation that can help users find fashion products that match their preferences. The system also aims to provide an interactive user interface that is easy to use and navigate.

*1. Personalization:*<br/> 
Tailoring recommendations based on individual user preferences and browsing behavior.
*2. Trend Identification: *
Identifying and recommending products that are currently trending or have high potential based on market demand and customer interest.
*3. Improved Engagement: *<br/>
Increasing user engagement by presenting relevant and appealing product recommendations.
*4. Sales Optimization: *<br/>
Driving sales by suggesting products that are likely to resonate with customers, thereby improving conversion rates.


## Features

*1. Collaborative Filtering:*<br/>
    Recommending trends based on similarities between users with similar tastes or preferences. This method leverages patterns in user behavior to suggest relevant trends.

*4. Visual Search and Recognition:*<br/>
        Enabling users to search for trends using images or visual cues. This feature can identify similar trends based on pattern recognition or image analysis.
   Users can upload images of fashion products they like, and the system will recommend similar products based on the ResNet-based feature extraction.

*5. Personalized recommendations:*<br/>
    The system provides personalized recommendations to users based on their preferences and past interactions with the website.

*6. Secure authentication:*
    Firebase authentication is used to ensure that only authorized users can access the website.
